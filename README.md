### Here's a few things I've done up until now..
- [TONYCRE8 Portfolio](https://github.com/TonyIngall/tonycre8-portfolio): Exactly what it sounds like, my digital portfolio!
- [CRE8-ANIMATION](https://github.com/TonyIngall/cre8-animation): A css and React library that contains styled, animated components.

### I'm constantly blogging too!
Every week, I try to write a blog article on technical topics and post them on [my website](https://tonycre8.co.uk/blog). Whether they be my explorations of different technologies, or me demonstrating the usage of said technologies through the use of tutorials.
